# little-snitch-rules
Generate Little Snitch rules to block adware and malware websites. Host lists from Steven Black (https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts).

## Subscribe to rule group in Little Snitch
If you don't want to create your own list, you can subscribe to the one I generated.
In Little Snitch, File --> New Rule Group Subscription, enter the url:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohadf/little-snitch-rules/master/adware_malware_list.lsrules

Requires Little Snitch 4.3 to handle large rule files.

## Create your own rules file
Feel free to use and modify my code to create your own list. You will need to host the result on a webserver and make it accessible to Little Snitch.
